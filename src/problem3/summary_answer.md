### Summary of what the Code does

The **WalletPage** component:

1. Fetches wallet balances (`useWalletBalances`) and currency prices (`usePrices`).
2. Filters and sorts wallet balances based on blockchain priority and amount.
3. Formats the balances.
4. Creates rows (`WalletRow`) for each balance. Each row has:
    - The wallet's balance amount.
    - The USD value.
    - The formatted string.
5. Renders these rows inside a `div`.


### Summary of Issues in the Code ###
(Detail comments will be in the **problem.js**)
1. declare value but not use
2. read wrong property
3. naming variable is not clearly
1. No need  `formattedBalances`
2. `useMemo` might not working
3. `getPriority` should be declared in `useWalletBalances` hook
